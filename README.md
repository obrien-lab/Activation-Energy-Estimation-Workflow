## Activation Energy Estimation Workflow

#### Author: [Dr. Yang Jiang](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1100-9177)

This is a package of python (3.X) scripts that are used to estimate activation free energy, as well as the ligand binding affinity, for a protein structure obtained from a [coarse-grained (CG) simulation](). All the scripts are ready to use when users have added the directories (including all the child folders) in `$PATH` (add `export PATH=${PATH}:/path/to/one/folder/` in your `~/.bashrc` file) and have granted the execution permission (`chmod -R +x ./act_ene_estimation/`) for all the scripts. 

:warning: The workflow requires additional softwares installed prior to use. Please click `Learn more` in the following script instruction tables to find detailed instruction of usage and basic theory used in the script.
